			"The United States produces enough food to feed the world several times over. Unfortunately, the United States alone wastes up to 50% of fresh produce each year. Yet, 1 in 9 Americans suffer from food security. This isn't even considering what happens with the rest of the world. Imagine that.",

			"AfterFarms was founded by two cofounders, Andrew and Garwing. The idea that lead to AfterFarms came when Garwing had a seemingly near death experience. Surprisingly, in the moment of near death, it's not a myth that your entire life flashes before you. Of all the things that one could care about in life, when the end nears, very little seems to matter. The only thing that seemed to linger for Garwing was, what was his trail? He realized that, life moves by quickly, but during this short time, we seem to focus on ourselves way too much. So much that we're rarely responsible for one hundred percent of our actions. When we're dead, we're gone. It's like a jail free card for all the actions that we've done, good or bad. But, it's the next generations that end up with either our mess, or our creations. With that, it seemed clear to Garwing that our only duty being alive is to truly create a better and sustainable home so that our existence can flourish. Or at least don't destroy it.",
		description4:
			"With this realization, Garwing became determined to leave a better trail for the future generations. After doing some research, Garwing learned about our current food waste situation. Surprisingly, not only is food waste causing food security in the world, it's also one of the biggest reasons for pollution: causing about 6-8% of the world's pollution. Coincidentally, it was around the same time when Garwing and Garwing's old friend, Andrew, ran into each other on the streets after 9 years of having last acquainted. The two decided to meet up for old times sake, and this idea of rescuing produce came about as their conversation brewed. At the time, Andrew was the CTO of another company, but had thoughts of starting his own business in produce. Andrew had experience in the tech/food industry, and was also passionate about produce: by this time, he had been growing his own produce in his backyards for 2 years already.",
		description5: "The two kicked it off immediately. It seemed that they were desinted to run into each other at the right time. After a few meetups and conversations, AfterFarms was born.",

		headerDescription: "Eco-friendly packaging",
		description:
			"We use fully biodegrable and recyclable corrugated cardboard boxes to ship our produce. Corrugated boxes are best for shipping produce because of their dry nature and loose fit. This allows for fresh air to keep the produce fresh, and lowers the chances for baterial growth. There is no need for insulators or ice packages in our packing because we only ship local, which means we deliver produce to you straight from the farms and distributors!",
